                <h2>Chapter 6: Firewalls & VPNs</h2>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>1. What is the typical relationship among the untrusted network, the firewall, and the trusted network?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">The firewall sits as a controlled gateway between the untrusted network (typically the public Internet) and the trusted network (the organization's internal network). All traffic must pass through the firewall, which enforces an access control policy.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>2. What is the relationship between a TCP packet and UDP packet? Will any specific transaction usually involve both types of packets?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Both are core transport layer protocols. TCP is connection-oriented and reliable, while UDP is connectionless and faster but doesn't guarantee delivery. A single transaction typically uses one or the other, not both.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>3. How is an application layer proxy firewall different from a packet-filtering firewall?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A packet-filtering firewall operates at the network and transport layers, making decisions based on headers. An application layer proxy firewall operates at the application layer, acting as an intermediary and inspecting the actual content of traffic.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>4. How is static filtering different from dynamic filtering of packets? Which is perceived to offer improved security?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Static filtering uses pre-configured, fixed rules, while dynamic filtering can create rules on the fly in response to traffic. Dynamic filtering is perceived as more secure because it's more adaptive.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>5. What is stateful inspection? How is state information maintained during a network connection or transaction?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Stateful inspection monitors the state of active connections and makes decisions based on context. It maintains a state table that tracks all current connections, including details like IPs, ports, and sequence numbers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>6. Explain the conceptual approach that should guide the creation of firewall rule sets.</h3>
                    <p class="answer">The guiding principle is "default-deny": "That which is not expressly permitted, is denied." The final rule should be an explicit "deny all," with rules ordered from most specific to most general.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>7. What special function does a cache server perform? Why is this useful for larger organizations?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A cache server stores frequently requested web content locally. This reduces bandwidth usage, improves user experience, and can provide content filtering and logging.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>8. Describe how the various types of firewalls interact with network traffic at various levels of the OSI model.</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Packet filtering operates at Layers 3 & 4; stateful inspection at Layers 3 & 4 with state awareness; application proxy at Layer 7; circuit-level proxy at Layer 5.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>9. What is a hybrid firewall?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A hybrid firewall combines several firewall techniques into a single system. Most modern firewalls are hybrids, incorporating packet filtering, stateful inspection, and application-level proxies.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>10. Describe Unified Threat Management. Why might it be a better approach than single-point solutions? How does UTM differ from Next Generation Firewalls?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">UTM is a single appliance combining multiple security functions (firewall, IDPS, antivirus, etc.). It offers simplified management and lower cost. UTM is a "jack-of-all-trades" for smaller businesses, while NGFW focuses on deeper inspection for enterprises.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>11. What is a Next Generation Firewall (NextGen or NGFW)?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A NGFW is a deep-packet inspection firewall that adds application-level inspection, intrusion prevention, and user identity awareness to standard stateful inspection.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>12. What is the primary value of a firewall?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">To enforce an organization's access control policy at the network boundary, controlling what traffic is allowed to enter or leave the trusted network.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>13. What is Port Address Translation (PAT) and how does it work?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">PAT allows multiple devices on a LAN to be mapped to a single public IP address by using unique source port numbers for each connection. The firewall keeps a translation table to route returning traffic correctly.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>14. How do screened host architectures for firewalls differ from screened subnet firewall architectures? Which offers more security?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Screened host uses a single firewall with a bastion host inside the trusted network. Screened subnet uses multiple firewalls to create a DMZ. Screened subnet offers more security due to multiple layers of defense.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>15. What is a sacrificial host? What is a bastion host?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A sacrificial host is fully exposed with the assumption it may be compromised. A bastion host is heavily fortified to resist attack. In practice, the terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>16. What is a DMZ? Is this really an appropriate name for the technology?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A DMZ is a neutral, controlled buffer network between trusted and untrusted networks. The name is appropriate as it describes a "buffer zone" where opposing forces can interact under controlled conditions.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>17. What questions must be addressed when selecting a firewall for a specific organization?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Key questions include: required technology type, cost, ease of management, security policies, performance requirements, and whether to bundle with other services.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>18. What is RADIUS? What advantage does it have over TACACS?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">RADIUS is a protocol for centralized authentication, authorization, and accounting. Its advantage is widespread support across network equipment and software.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>19. What is a content filter? Where is it placed in the network to gain the best result?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A content filter restricts access to certain online content. It's best placed at the network egress point to filter all traffic for all users.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>20. What is a VPN? Why is it becoming more widely used?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A VPN is a secure, encrypted tunnel over a public network. It's widely used for secure remote access, cost-effective branch office connections, and protecting data on untrusted networks.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h3>1. What common security system is an IDPS most like? In what ways are these systems similar?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">An IDPS is most like a burglar alarm. Both monitor for unauthorized activity and trigger alerts to notify responsible parties.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>2. How does a false positive alarm differ from a false negative alarm? From a security perspective, which is less desirable?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A false positive incorrectly flags normal activity as an attack. A false negative misses an actual attack. False negatives are less desirable as they leave the organization unaware of real threats.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>3. How does a network-based IDPS differ from a host-based IDPS?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A NIDPS monitors network traffic across segments, while a HIDPS monitors activity on a single host like system logs and file access.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>4. How does a signature-based IDPS differ from a behavior-based IDPS?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Signature-based uses known attack patterns, while behavior-based establishes a baseline of normal behavior and flags deviations.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>5. What is a monitoring (or SPAN) port? What is it used for?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A SPAN port receives copies of all network traffic passing through a switch. It's used to connect monitoring tools like NIDPS or packet sniffers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>6. List and describe the three control strategies proposed for IDPSs.</h3>
                    <p class="answer">1. Control Centralization: All functions managed from a single location. 2. Control Fully Distributed: Functions applied at each monitored component. 3. Partially Distributed: Hybrid approach with local agents and central management.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>7. What is a honeypot? How is it different from a honeynet?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A honeypot is a single decoy system to study attackers. A honeynet is a network of multiple honeypots creating a more realistic decoy environment.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>8. How does a padded cell system differ from a honeypot?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A honeypot lures attackers into a decoy. A padded cell is a quarantined environment that a live system is moved into after an attack is detected.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>9. What is network footprinting?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">The first phase of reconnaissance where an attacker gathers publicly available information about a target to define its attack surface.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>10. What is network fingerprinting?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Active reconnaissance involving probing a target's network to gather detailed information about systems, OS, open ports, and services.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>11. How are network footprinting and network fingerprinting related?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">They are sequential steps in reconnaissance. Footprinting provides the broad map, while fingerprinting fills in specific technical details.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>12. Why do many organizations ban port scanning activities on their internal networks?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">To detect malicious insiders, reduce network noise, and enforce policy that such activities must be authorized.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>13. Why would ISPs ban outbound port scanning by their customers?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Outbound scanning often indicates a compromised system being used to attack other networks, which ISPs want to prevent.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>14. What is an open port? Why is it important to limit the number of open ports to those that are absolutely essential?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">An open port accepts incoming connections. Each represents a potential entry point for attackers, so limiting them reduces the attack surface.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>15. What is a system's attack surface? Why should it be minimized when possible?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">The attack surface is the sum of all potential points where unauthorized users can try to enter or extract data. Minimizing it reduces opportunities for attackers.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>16. What is a vulnerability scanner? How is it used to improve security?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">An automated tool that scans systems to identify known security weaknesses. It's used proactively to find and patch vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>17. What is the difference between active and passive vulnerability scanners?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">Active scanners probe targets directly, while passive scanners monitor network traffic without direct interaction. Active is more accurate but intrusive; passive is stealthier but less comprehensive.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
                    <h3>18. What is Metasploit Framework? Why is it considered riskier to use than other vulnerability scanning tools?</h3>
                    <p class="answer">A penetration testing tool that provides vulnerability information and aids in exploit development. It's riskier because it actively exploits vulnerabilities, which can crash systems.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="question">
